<h2>Stripe</h2> is a payment processing platform that allows businesses to accept payments online, in person, and over the phone. Stripe APIs provide developers with a way to integrate Stripe's payment processing capabilities into their own applications.
Stripe APIs are designed to be easy to use and scalable. They are available in a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
